            <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
            <p>Well honestly speaking from a young age, I have been fascinated by the boundless potential of technology.
                Growing up in Nigeria where technological resources were very scarce I became fascinated by the
                possibilities that the digital world presented. My first encounter with technology's potential came
                through a computer game, which ignited a curiosity in me about what made it all work. As I look deeper,
                I realized that behind every engaging interface and seamless experience there's a code and design. This
                discovery set me on a path toward becoming a software engineer, fueled by passion and a commitment to
                self-learning.
                I joined the Alt School program to deepen my understanding of software engineering and to gain practical
                experience in building scalable and efficient systems. The program's hands-on approach and mentorship
                align perfectly with my learning goals.</p>
